    <h1><code>ReClassicParser</code>'s regular expression syntax</h1>

    <p>The regular expression syntax employed by <a
    href="../ReClassicParser.html">ReClassicParser</a> is similar but
    not the same as that used in <code>perl, python, tcl</code> or the
    C library. The two reasons for this are that it sacrifices some
    features for speed and that it contains operators which are not
    known in standard implementations: <a
    href="../Nfa.html#invert()">invert()</a>, <a
    href="../Nfa.html#not()">not()</a> and <a
    href="../Nfa.html#shortest()">shortest()</a>.
    </p>
    
    <p>Regular expressions are built up from <em>atoms</em> and
    <em>operators</em> which combine atoms into larger regular
    expressions.
    </p>


    <h4>Atoms</h4>
      
    <dl class="cList">
      <dt><em>c</em></dt>
      <dd>A single character is a regular expression matching exactly
	this character. Characters with a special meaning in the
	regular expression syntax must be escaped as described
	below. Since Java is UNICODE based, a character can be any
	UNICODE character.
      </dd>
      <dt>\<em>c</em></dt>
      <dd>A character escaped by a preceding backslash matches that
	character, even if that character otherwise has a special
	meaning in the regular expression syntax. Note that two
	consecutive backslash characters are needed in constant
	strings within Java programs. To construct an <code>Nfa</code>
	which matches the open bracket, write<pre>
Nfa nfa = new Nfa("\\[")</pre>
      <dt>[<em>...</em>]</dt>
      <dd>A set of characters enclosed in brackets matches
	any single character mentioned in the set. Within the
	brackets, a range of characters is denoted by the first and
	the last character of the range separated by the dash,
	e.g. <code>[a-z]</code>. If the caret <code>"^"</code> is the
	first character within the brackets, the character set is
	inverted, i.e. it will match any character not in the set. To
	include the right bracket, dash or caret in the set, they must
	be preceeded by a backslash. (Two backslashes in constant
	strings in a Java program, because one backslash is eaten up
	by the compiler.)
      </dd>
      <dt>(<em>re</em>)</dt>
      <dd>A regular expression <em>re</em> enclosed in parentheses
	matches exactly whatever the <em>re</em> matches.
      </dd>
      <dt>(!<em>re</em>)</dt>
      <dd>A regular expression <em>re</em> enclosed by
	<q><code>(!</code></q> 
	and <q><code>)</code></q>
	matches exactly whatever the <em>re</em> matches. In addition,
	the <em>re</em> is made into a <a href="#rse">reporting
	  subexpression</a>. 
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <h4>Operators</h4>
    <dl class="cList">
      <dt><em>re</em>?</dt>
      <dd>A regular expression <em>re</em> followed by the question
	mark matches <em>re</em> or the empty string.
      </dd>
      <dt><em>re</em>+</dt>
      <dd>A regular expression <em>re</em> followed by the plus sign
	matches one or more occurences of <em>re</em>.
      </dd>
      <dt><em>re</em>*</dt>
      <dd>A regular expression <em>re</em> followed by the asterisk
	matches zero or more occurences of <em>re</em>.
      </dd>
      <dt><em>re</em>!</dt>
      <dd>A regular expression <em>re</em> followed by the exclamation
	mark matches the shortest match satisfying <em>re</em>. This
	operator is particularly useful to <b>jump to the first
	  occurence</b> of some string. For example the expression
	<code>"(.*&lt;/b&gt;)!"</code> matches everything up to and
	including the first <code>"&lt;/b&gt;"</code> found. A
	comparison with the non-greedy <code>"*"</code> operator
	available in other regular expression engines can
	be found <a href="#greed">below</a>.
      </dd>
      <dt><em>re</em>~</dt>
      <dd>A regular expression <em>re</em> followed by the tilde
	matches any string which does <b>not match</b>
	<em>re</em> (See also <a href="../Nfa.html#not()">invert()</a>.)
      <dt><em>re</em>^</dt>
      <dd>A regular expression <em>re</em> followed by the hat (caret)
	matches any string which does <b>not contain</b> a match of
	<em>re</em>. The tilde operator is a convenience shortcut for
	<code>"((.*re.*)?)^"</code>. If in doubt whether to use
	<code>re~</code> or <code>re^</code>, read the explanation
	about <a href="../Nfa.html#not()">not()</a>. 
      </dd>
      <dt><em>re<sub>1</sub>re<sub>2</sub></em></dt>
      <dd>matches all strings which match
	<em>re<sub>1</sub></em> immediately followed by a match of
	<em>re<sub>2</sub></em>.
      </dd>
      <dt><em>re<sub>1</sub></em>|<em>re<sub>2</sub></em></dt>
      <dd>matches all strings which match either
	<em>re<sub>1</sub></em> or <em>re<sub>2</sub></em>.
      </dd>
    </dl>

    <a name="rse"><h2>Reporting Subexpressions</h2>
    <p>In his reference book about regular expressions, 
    <a href="http://www.oreilly.com/catalog/regex2/index.html">Friedl</a> 
    notes on page 150 that</p>
    <blockquote>
      The way a DFA engine works completely precludes these concepts.
    </blockquote>
    while referring to <q>reporting subexpressions</q>. Since this
    package relies on deterministic finite automata (DFA), there
    should be no reporting subexpressions. But there are. And in
    general &mdash; they do not work.</p>

    <p>But for many practically relevant cases they do work quite
    well. It requires, however, some overhead to keep track of
    subexpressions in the DFA. This is why, in contrast to other
    packages, reporting subexpressions are not the default. They have
    to be specifically requested by enclosing a regular expression in
    <q><code>(!</code></q> and <q><code>)</code></q>, like in
    <code>"(![ab]+)"</code>.
    </p>

    <p>As mentioned above, subexpression tracking is not perfect. It
    breaks down in particular when the reporting subexpression
    competes with another subexpression in matching. As an example
    consider</p>
    <blockquote>
      <code>(!(ab)+)(!abc)</code>
    </blockquote>
    which matches a sequence of 'a's and 'b's terminated by a
    'c'. Obviously the two subexpressions overlap on the string
    <code>"ab"</code> and the implementation will report this: within
    the string</p>
    <blockquote>
      <code>"---ababc---"<code>
    </blockquote>
    <p>the match <code>"ababc"</code> will be found with the two
    submatches <code>"abab"</code> and <code>"abc"</code> assigned to
    the two subexpressions respectively.
    </p>
    <p>As another example consider the regular expression</p>
    <blockquote>
      <code>(!ab*)(!abc)</code>
    </blockquote>
    <p>when matching in the string
    <code>"---aaaabc---aaababc---"</code>. Then the reported match and
      its first and second subgroup are as follows:</p>

    <div>
      <table style="float:left;  margin-left:1cm; margin-right:1cm; margin-bottom:1em;" cellpadding="2px" rules="all" border="2">
	<thead>
	  <tr><td>%0</td><td>%1</td><td>%2</td></tr>
	</thead>
	<tbody>
	  <tr><td>aabc</td><td>a</td><td>abc</td></tr>
	  <tr><td>ababc</td><td>ab</td><td>abc</td></tr>
	</tbody>
      </table>
 
      <p style="float:left; vertical-align:top; width:6cm; font-size:smaller">See 
	<a href="../PrintfFormatter.html">monq.jfa.PrintFormatter</a>
	for an explanation of 
	how to use <code>%0</code>, etc. in format strings. Submatches
	and formatting are used together in a 
	<a href="../actions/Printf.html">monq.jfa.actions.Printf</a>
	object.</p>
    </div>
    <p style="clear:left">The difference to the previous example is that when the second
    <code>'a'</code> of the matching string is seen, there is no doubt
    that the second subgroup has to be entered. In the previous
    example, when encountering the second <code>'a'</code>, it may be
      the start of another <code>"ab"</code> pair of the first
      subgroup or it may be the start of the second subgroup.</p>

    <p>The bottom line is: the more clear cut the separation between
      subexpressions is, the better it will work. Nested
      subexpressions may work, but are not at all tested.
    </p>

    <a name="broken"><h2>What if reporting subexpressions do not
      work</h2></a> 
    <p>If the results of using submatches turn out to be unusable, 
      <code>Jfa</code> offers also another approach to
      get hold of parts of a long match. The matched string is simply
      analysed a second time. But since the matching text is known to
      stem from a certain regular expression, its structure is known
      and verified. Consequently the second analysis can usually be
      quick, simple and dirty. Examples are splits at fixed character
      positions or fixed characters. Callback objects which split a
      matched text must be of type 
      <a href="../TextSplitter.html">TextSplitter</a>. The interface
      describes functionality to split a string of known structure
      into parts. The course of action then goes like this:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
	The DFA finds a match which has interesting parts.</li>
      <li>
	The whole match is split into parts by a
	<a href="../TextSplitter.html">TextSplitter</a>.</li> 
      <li>
	Finally, a <a href="../Formatter.html">Formatter</a> is called
	to rearrange 
	the resulting parts into the output.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      When it comes to using a <code>TextSplitter</code> there are two
      scenarios:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
	When you have full control over the regular expression and the
	associated <code>TextSplitter</code>, there is actually no
	reason to use a <code>Formatter</code>. Just write a normal
	<code>FaAction</code> which calls the
	<code>TextSplitter</code> and then use the result to assemble
	some new text to replace the matched text.</li>
      <li>
	If, however, you want to supply only the regular expression
	and a corresponding <code>TextSplitter</code> as a module for
	other programmers to use, then write a method which creates an
	<code>Nfa</code> bound to an <code>FaAction</code> which first
	calls your <code>TextSplitter</code> and passes result to the
	<code>Formatter</code> supplied by the user of your
	module.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      An example of the latter is 
      <a href="../Xml.html#EmptyElemTagNfa(monq.jfa.Formatter)">EmptyElemTagNfa</a> which
      makes sure that the regular expression used and the
      <code>TextSplitter</code> applied correspond to each other.
    </p>



    <a name="greed"><h2>Non Greedy Matching vs. Shortest
    Match</h2></a> <p>The difference is best explained by an
    example. When trying to match a full XML element followed by a
    certain context, one may be tempted to write<pre>
    &lt;tag&gt;.*?&lt;/tag&gt;&lt;otherTag&gt;</pre> employing the
    non-greedy operator <code>"*?"</code> available in 
    <code>java.util.regex</code>. However, non-greedy
    operators sacrifice the shortest possible match for an overall
    match of the regular expression if necessary. Consequently the
    above expression would match the text<pre>
    &lt;tag&gt;bla&lt;/tag&gt;&lt;somestuff&gt;...&lt;/somestuff&gt;&lt;tag&gt;xxx&lt;/tag&gt;&lt;otherTag&gt;</pre>
    just because the longer match satisfies the regular expression,
    while stopping at the first <code>&lt;/tag&gt;</code> would
    not match.</p> <p>In contrast, the shortest match operator as
    implemented by <code>jfa</code> does not give up the shortest
    possible match of a subexpression to allow the whole expression to
    match. Consequently, <pre>
    &lt;tag&gt;(.*&lt;/tag&gt;)!&lt;otherTag&gt;</pre> would not match
    at the beginning of the above string.</p>
