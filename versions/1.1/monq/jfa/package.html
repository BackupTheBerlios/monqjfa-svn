    <p>Implements Finite Automata, deterministic and
      nondeterministic, with an engine for high throughput filtering of
      text. There is a complete <a href="doc-files/Example.java">example program</a>
      available the main parts of which are described below.</p>

    <p>A typical use of this package involves the following steps.
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Creation of an {@link monq.jfa.Nfa} comprising one or more <a
      href="doc-files/resyntax.html">regular expressions</a> to which
      {@link monq.jfa.FaAction} callbacks are attached.  The
      <code>Nfa</code> defined below matches identifiers and positive
      integers. It has actions attached to tag them with &lt;id&gt;
      and &lt;num&gt; respectively.
	<pre>
import monq.jfa.*;
import monq.jfa.actions.*;
Nfa nfa = 
  new Nfa(<font color="green">"[A-Za-z_][A-Za-z0-9_]*"</font>, new Printf("&lt;id&gt;%0&lt;/id&gt;"))
      .or(<font color="green">"[0-9]+"</font>, new Printf("&lt;num&gt;%0&lt;/num&gt;"));</pre>
      </li>
      <li>Compilation of the <code>Nfa</code> into a {@link monq.jfa.Dfa}.
	<pre>
Dfa dfa = nfa.compile({@link monq.jfa.DfaRun#UNMATCHED_COPY}); </pre>
	A <code>Dfa</code> is a data structure that allows to match
	the regular expessions which where stuck into the
	<code>Nfa</code>. The running time depends only linearly on the
	length of the input string. The parameter given to
	<code>compile()</code> specifies how non-matching input shall
	be treated. In this case it is copied unchanged to the output.
      </li>
      <li>To operate the <code>Dfa</code>, it must be wrapped in a
      {@link monq.jfa.DfaRun} which applies the <code>Dfa</code> to input
      data, e.g. the standard input stream.
	<pre>
DfaRun run = new DfaRun(dfa, new ReaderCharSource(System.in));</pre>	
      </li>
      <li>Finally, the <code>DfaRun</code> is asked to filter to <code>System.out</code>:
	<pre>
run.filter(System.out);</pre>
	There are also methods to {@link monq.jfa.DfaRun#read() read()} from a
	<code>DfaRun</code>.
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Now you may want to compile and run the 
      <a href="doc-files/Example.java">slightly more elaborate example</a>.
    </p>


    <h3>Feature Highlights</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>A <code>DfaRun</code> can be used as the input source for
	another <code>DfaRun</code>:<pre>
  DfaRun a = new DfaRun(..., new ReaderCharSource(System.in));
  DfaRun b = new DfaRun(..., <font color="red">a</font>);</pre>
      </li>
      <li>An {@link monq.jfa.FaAction} is allowed to change the {@link
	monq.jfa.Dfa} of 
	a {@link monq.jfa.DfaRun} on the fly. This allows for pieces of text to
	be operated upon by different <code>Dfa</code>s. A general
	action to change the <code>Dfa</code> is {@link
	monq.jfa.actions.SwitchDfa}. 
      </li>
      <li>There are many predefined general purpose callbacks
	available in the package {@link monq.jfa.actions}.
      </li>
      <li>You can push back an arbitrary number of characters into the
	input of a <code>DfaRun</code> with {@link monq.jfa.DfaRun#unskip
	DfaRun.unskip()}. This in particular allows matches with a
	trailing context. You only have push back the context in the
	action callback.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Computational Model</h3>
    <p>The model of operation implemented by this package was
      inspired by <em>LEX &mdash; Lexical Analyzer Generator</em>
      described in 1975 by M.E.Lesk and E.Schmidt in the 
      <em>UNIX Programmer's Manual</em> and its more recent GNU incarnation
      <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/flex/">flex</a>. This means
      in particular that the software operates as a filter which
      changes text as it passes through the machinery. Filtering,
      i.e. changing text, is initiated whenever a regular expression
      encoded in the machinery matches. The filter operation itself is
      carried out by callbacks invoked for every matching piece of
      text. Apart from changing the text, the callback may count
      occurences, record things in a database, or do whatever can be
      done with a piece of java code.
    </p>
    <p>The interface of such a callback is {@link
      monq.jfa.FaAction}. Normally you just need to extend {@link
      monq.jfa.AbstractFaAction} and implement the {@link
      monq.jfa.FaAction#invoke invoke()} method.
      Commonly used callbacks can be found in the package {@link
      monq.jfa.actions}.
    </p>
    <p>While this implementation uses fast <em>deterministic finite
    automata</em> (DFA) for matching, it nevertheless implements the
    tracking of submatches. A description of the formal
    behaviour of the method used shows that it simply does not work in
    the general case, but it works quite well in many practical
    applications. Nevertheless care must be taken when using
    submatches, as sometimes results are a little surprising. For more
    information see the description of <a
    href="doc-files/resyntax.html#rse">subexpressions</a> as well as
    what to do <a href="doc-files/resyntax.html#broken">if they don't
	work</a>.
