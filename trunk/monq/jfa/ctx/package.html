    <p>
      adds support for recursive parsing to jfa that in particular
      allows easy XML parsing as an alternative to SAX. The classes
      supplied do not rely on XML. Rather they provide a more general
      concept of which XML is a special case. The concept implemented
      is called a <em>parsing context</em>. It is defined by the
      stretch of text between matches of two regular expressions for
      the start and the end of the context. The classes in this
      package set up and maintain a stack of such parsing
      contexts. More importantly, they allow context specific action
      callbacks via {@link monq.jfa.ctx.IfContext}.
    </p>

    <p>
      Parsing contexts are set up by adding {@link
      monq.jfa.ctx.Context} actions to a {@link monq.jfa.Nfa}. While
      this could in principle be done directly with calls to {@link
      monq.jfa.Nfa#or Nfa.or()}, it would be tedious and error
      prone. Instead, a {@link monq.jfa.ctx.ContextManager} must be
      used to populate the <code>Nfa</code>. A typical call to a
      <code>ContextManager</code> looks like this:
      </p>
    <pre>
  ContextManager cmgr = new ContextManager(nfa);
  Context ctx = cmgr.addXml("server")</pre>
    <p>
      This will add two actions to <code>nfa</code> that push/pop a
      context to/from a stack when matching an XML start/end tag with
      the name <code>server</code>. The context can then be used in
      combination with a conditional action:</p>
    <pre>
  nfa.or(Xml.GoofedElement("hostname"), 
         new IfContext(ctx, new StoreHostname())</pre>
    <p>
      The <code>IfContext</code> action makes sure that
      <code>StoreHostname</code> is only called if the
      <code>hostname</code> XML element is found in the given context
      <code>ctx</code>. Additional contexts can be added with {@link
      monq.jfa.ctx.IfContext#ifthen IfContext.ifthen()} and {@link
      monq.jfa.ctx.IfContext#elsedo 
      IfContext.elsedo()}.
    </p>
    
    <p>A context can be used as the parent of another context by
      calling <code>addXml</code> with the parent context as a
      parameter:
    </p>
    <pre>
  Context child = cmgr.addXml(ctx, "propertyList")</pre>
    <p>
      This will wrap the push operation for the generated child
      context into an <code>IfContext</code> action to make sure it is
      only performed in the given parent context. The internally generated
      <code>IfContext</code> object is not available for
      direct manipulation, e.g. for adding an <code>elsdo()</code>, but it
      is safe to directly add an unconditional action to
      the <code>nfa</code> which will then serve as the default
      action. Similarly, it is ok to add an additional
      <code>IfContext</code> object for the same match but for a
      different context.
    </p>

    <p>By default, the text matching the start and the end of a
      context is copied untouched to the output. This can be generally
      changed with {@link monq.jfa.ctx.ContextManager#setDefaultAction
      ContextManager.setDefaultAction()}
      and similar 
      methods, as well as per context with {@link
      monq.jfa.ctx.Context#setStartAction Context.setStartAction()} etc.
    </p>

    <h3>Where is the stack</h3>
    <p>During operation of the automaton with a <code>DfaRun</code>,
      the field {@link monq.jfa.DfaRun#clientData} must contain an
      object which 
      implements the {@link monq.jfa.ctx.ContextStackProvider}
      interface. The <code>Context</code> actions use the
      {@link java.util.List} provided by this interface as a
      stack. Client actions added to a <code>Context</code> with
      e.g. <code>Context.setStartAction()</code> may also use the
      stack for their own business, as long as they perform paired
      push and pop operations.
    </p>
    <p>For convenience, the method {@link
      monq.jfa.ctx.ContextManager#createStackProvider} returns a
      trivial implementation of a <code>ContextStackProvider</code>:
    </p>
    <pre>
  DfaRun r = new DfaRun(dfa, ...);
  r.clientData = ContextManager.createStackProvider();</pre>
    <p>If, however, the <code>clientData</code> field has to carry
      your own information, the object you store in
      <code>clientData</code> need for example only contain an {@link
      java.util.ArrayList} and the method {@link
      monq.jfa.ctx.ContextStackProvider#getStack()} which returns it.
    </p>
