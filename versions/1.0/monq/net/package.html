    <p>Simple tcp server and clients. </p>

    <h4><code>TcpServer</code>, <code>Service</code> and
      <code>ServiceFactory</code></h4> 

    <p>The most basic class provided is {@link monq.net.TcpServer}
    which handles all the nasty bits of setting up a network
    connection. For every incoming connection it asks a {@link
    monq.net.ServiceFactory} to generate a {@link
    monq.net.Service}. The <code>Service</code> is then plumbed up
    with the I/O streams of the network connection and its
    <code>run()</code> method called. When that finishes, the
    <code>TcpServer</code> cleans up the remains of the thread and
    closes the connection.</p>

    <h4><code>DfaService</code> and <code>DfaRunService</code></h4>

    <p>If you have a class that creates a {@link monq.jfa.DfaRun}
    object, it can implement the interface <code>ServiceFactory</code>
    by wrapping the <code>DfaRun</code> into a into a {@link
    monq.net.DfaRunService}.</p>

    <p>Example<pre>
  public createService(java.io.InputStream in, 
                       java.io.OutputStream out) {
    DfaRun r = ... // do whatever is necessary 
                   // to create a DfaRun
    r.setIn(in);
    return new DfaRunService(r, new PrintStream(out));
  }</pre>
    </p>
    
    <h4><code>FilterServiceFactory</code> and
      <code>DistPipeFilter</code></h4> 

    <p>To set up one element of a distributed filter pipeline, use
    a {@link monq.net.FilterServiceFactory}. Suppose you have a
      <code>ServiceFactory</code> object called
      <code>mySF</code>. Then do the 
      following:<pre>  FilterServiceFactory fsf = new FilterServiceFactory(mySF);
  int port = 3456;
  new TcpServer(port, fsf).serve();</pre>
    As a result, the service created for connections on the given port
      will read from its input stream instructions of how to fetch
      input data, normally from another upstream server. It
      establishes the connection and plumbs up your underlying service
      with the input from upstream and the output to downstream, all
      fully automatic.
    </p>

    <p>To access a pipeline of filter services as described above, use
      {@link monq.net.DistPipeFilter} or its command line wrapper
      {@link monq.programs DistFilter}.</p>
